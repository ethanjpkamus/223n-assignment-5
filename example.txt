HOW TO DETECT MOUSE CLICK
(applex,appley)
(mousex,mousey)

bool caught = false;
double dist;

protected override void OnMouseDown(MouseEventsArgs e){
// when the mouse is clicked, the computer will create an event that stores the
// x and y coords of where the mouse was clicked on screen
	mousex = e.X;
	mousey = e.Y;
	dist = (mousex - (apple + radius))^2 + (mousey - (apple+radius))^2;

	if(dist^2 < radius^2 && apple > 800){
	//check if the click is within the circle and if the apple is above the control area.
		caught = true;
	} else {
		caught = false;
	}

	base.OnMouseDown(e);
}

protected override void OnPaint(PaintEventArgs e){

	Graphics graph = e.Graphics;

	if(!caught){
		g.FillEllipse(Brushes.Red,8,8,applex,appley);
		base.OnPaint(graph);
	}

}

first start off with one apple on the screen at a time, then create more and more
